Arduino Uno Board

The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller - simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

Getting Started:
1. Connect your Arduino Uno board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Install the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Open the Arduino IDE.
4. Select "Arduino Uno" from the "Tools > Board" menu.
5. Select the appropriate port from the "Tools > Port" menu (the port your Arduino Uno is connected to).
6. Write your Arduino code in the IDE or open an existing sketch.
7. Click the "Upload" button to upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.
8. Monitor the serial output using the "Serial Monitor" tool in the IDE (optional).
9. Experiment with different projects and circuits using the Arduino Uno board.

Key Features:
- 14 digital input/output pins: These pins can be used for digital input or output. They support both 5V and 3.3V logic levels.
- 6 analog input pins: These pins can read analog voltage values ranging from 0 to 5 volts.
- USB connection: Allows the Arduino Uno to be connected to a computer for programming and communication.
- Power jack: Enables the Arduino Uno to be powered using an AC-to-DC adapter.
- ICSP header: Allows for in-circuit serial programming of the ATmega328P microcontroller.
- Reset button: Resets the microcontroller, restarting the code execution.

Applications:
- DIY projects: Build custom electronic projects, gadgets, and prototypes.
- Robotics: Control motors, sensors, and actuators in robotics projects.
- Home automation: Create smart home devices for controlling lights, appliances, and more.
- Education: Learn about programming, electronics, and microcontrollers in schools and universities.
- IoT (Internet of Things): Connect sensors and devices to the internet for data collection and remote control.
