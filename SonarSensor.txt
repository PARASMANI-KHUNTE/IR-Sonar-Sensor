Sonar (Ultrasonic) Sensor

This Arduino code demonstrates the usage of a sonar (ultrasonic) sensor to measure distance by emitting ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back from obstacles.

Components Required:
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic (Sonar) sensor
- Optional: LED, buzzer, or motor for indicating proximity or distance

Wiring:
- Connect the trig pin of the sonar sensor to a digital pin on the Arduino for sending trigger signals.
- Connect the echo pin of the sonar sensor to another digital pin on the Arduino for receiving echo signals.
- Connect additional components (LED, buzzer, motor) to indicate proximity or distance as desired.

Instructions:
1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Adjust the threshold distance or sensitivity settings in the code as needed.
3. Connect the sonar sensor and any additional components according to the wiring instructions.
4. Power up your Arduino board.
5. Observe the behavior of the sonar sensor and the connected components as objects or obstacles are detected within its sensing range.

Note: 
- Ensure that the code and wiring are configured correctly to match the specifications of your sonar sensor module.
- Customize the code to perform specific actions (e.g., activate an alarm, stop a motor) based on the measured distance and the requirements of your project.
